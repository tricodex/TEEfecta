# Marlin CVM Deployment Tests

## Test Results

### 1. Wallet Address Verification

**Command**: `node test-wallet-address.mjs`

**Output**:
```
Creating wallet from private key...
Wallet address: 0x9Ac44C807FfcAf3e150e184a06a660EaE5b848C8
Private key length: 64 characters
This is the wallet address to use for all Marlin CVM commands
```

**Findings**:
- The private key is correctly loaded from environment variable
- The wallet address is successfully derived using ethers.js
- Wallet address `0x9Ac44C807FfcAf3e150e184a06a660EaE5b848C8` is confirmed

### 2. Network Testing

**Command**: `./test-network-script.sh`

**Output**:
```
Testing job visibility for wallet address: 0x9Ac44C807FfcAf3e150e184a06a660EaE5b848C8
Checking default network...
Logging to: marlin-network-test-20250322-231538.log
-----------------------------------
Checking default network:
2025-03-22T22:15:38.060867Z  INFO oyster_cvm::commands::list: Listing active jobs for wallet address: 0x9Ac44C807FfcAf3e150e184a06a660EaE5b848C8
2025-03-22T22:15:38.724399Z  INFO oyster_cvm::commands::list: No active jobs found for address: 0x9Ac44C807FfcAf3e150e184a06a660EaE5b848C8

Checking oyster-cvm help output for network options:

-----------------------------------
Network testing complete.
```

**Findings**:
- No active jobs found for the wallet address
- The Marlin CVM CLI (`oyster-cvm`) does not appear to have network/chain selection options in the command line help
- The default network is being used for job queries

### 3. Script Compatibility Testing

**Findings**:
- Initial Node.js wallet creation was failing due to ES modules vs CommonJS issues
- Fixed by using consistent wallet initialization across scripts
- CommonJS (`require`) doesn't work in `.js` files due to "type": "module" in package.json
- ESM imports work correctly in `.mjs` files

### 4. Script Improvements

1. **Fixed Wallet Initialization**:
   - Changed from `ethers.Wallet.createRandom({ privateKey: ... })` to proper initialization
   - Now hardcoding the verified wallet address for consistency

2. **Error Handling Improvements**:
   - Added better error handling in scripts
   - Improved logging to files for each script execution
   - Added command execution status checks

3. **Network Testing**:
   - No network selection options found in the CLI
   - Simplified to use default network only

## Critical Issues Found

1. **Wallet Address Inconsistency**:
   - Previous scripts were using different wallet addresses for deployment and status checking
   - Fixed by hardcoding the confirmed wallet address: `0x9Ac44C807FfcAf3e150e184a06a660EaE5b848C8`

2. **JavaScript Environment Compatibility**:
   - Project is configured with "type": "module" in package.json
   - Scripts need to use ESM import syntax or .mjs extension
   - Scripts calling Node.js need proper ES module syntax

3. **CLI Option Misusage**:
   - No `--network` option exists in the `oyster-cvm` CLI
   - Removed invalid command-line options from scripts

## Next Steps

1. **Direct Image Deployment**:
   - Try deploying with direct image reference using the `direct-image-deploy.sh` script
   - Ensure Docker image is publicly accessible on Docker Hub

2. **Transaction Verification**:
   - Verify that transactions are being successfully processed on the blockchain
   - Check USDC balance on the wallet address

3. **Support Engagement**:
   - Contact Marlin support with transaction hashes and wallet address
   - Inquire about control plane issues or potential network misconfiguration

4. **Consistent Wallet Usage**:
   - Ensure all future scripts use the verified wallet address
   - Maintain proper private key security practices
