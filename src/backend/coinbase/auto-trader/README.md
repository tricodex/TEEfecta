```

## WebSocket Events

Connect to the WebSocket server at `ws://localhost:3200` to receive real-time updates.

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `trade_started` | A new trade has been initiated |
| `trade_completed` | A trade has been completed |
| `trade_failed` | A trade has failed |
| `analysis_started` | Portfolio analysis has started |
| `analysis_completed` | Portfolio analysis is complete |
| `market_update` | Market data has been updated |
| `agent_thinking` | Agent is making a decision |

## Autonomous Trading

The agent can be configured to run in autonomous mode, making trading decisions at regular intervals based on market conditions and portfolio performance.

To enable autonomous mode, set `ENABLE_AUTONOMOUS_MODE=true` in your `.env` file.

## Web Search Integration

The agent utilizes Tavily API for real-time market data and news analysis. This enhances the agent's decision-making by incorporating up-to-date information about market trends, asset performance, and relevant news.

# 4G3N7 Auto Trader Test Suite

This repository contains a comprehensive test suite for the 4G3N7 Auto Trader application, which integrates with Azure OpenAI for trading analysis and Recall Network for decentralized storage.

## Overview

The test suite validates the following components:

1. **Azure OpenAI Integration** - Tests connection, error handling, and fallback mechanisms
2. **Recall Network Integration** - Tests storage, retrieval, and querying of data
3. **Integration Tests** - Tests the interaction between Azure OpenAI and Recall Network
4. **End-to-End Tests** - Full system tests with fallback handling

## Prerequisites

Before running the tests, ensure you have:

1. Bun installed (minimum version 1.2.0)
2. Environment files configured:
   - `.env` - Application environment variables
   - `.env.export` - Recall Network environment exports
   - `.env.azure` - Azure OpenAI configuration

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository if you haven't already
git clone <repository-url>
cd path/to/repo/src/backend/coinbase/auto-trader

# Install dependencies using Bun
bun install
```

## Environment Configuration

Create the necessary environment files:

### .env.azure

```
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://your-endpoint.openai.azure.com
AZURE_OPENAI_API_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=gpt-4o
AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=2023-12-01-preview
```

### .env.export

This file should contain the Recall Network environment exports, typically generated by the Recall CLI.

## Running Tests

The test suite includes several commands for different testing scenarios:

```bash
# Run all tests
bun test-all

# Run specific test files
bun test-azure     # Azure OpenAI integration tests
bun test-recall    # Recall Network integration tests
bun test-integration   # Combined integration tests
bun test-e2e       # End-to-end tests
```

## Test Categories

### Azure OpenAI Tests

Located in `tests/azure.test.ts`, these tests verify:

- Connection to Azure OpenAI API
- Graceful handling of API errors
- Fallback mechanisms when the API is unavailable

### Recall Network Tests 

Located in `tests/recall.test.ts`, these tests verify:

- Storage of data in the Recall Network
- Retrieval of stored data
- Handling of missing data
- Listing bucket contents

### Integration Tests

Located in `tests/integration.test.ts`, these tests verify:

- Interaction between Azure OpenAI and Recall Network
- Handling of service failures
- Recovery mechanisms
- Idempotent operations

### End-to-End Tests

Located in `tests/e2e.test.ts`, these tests verify:

- Complete workflow from analysis to storage
- Fallback to mock analysis when Azure OpenAI is unavailable
- Memory storage and retrieval

## Test Design

The tests are designed to be resilient to service failures:

1. **Graceful degradation** - Tests pass even if services are unavailable, testing fallback mechanisms
2. **Idempotency** - Operations can be repeated without side effects
3. **Isolation** - Tests don't depend on the state from other tests

## Troubleshooting

### Azure OpenAI 404 Errors

If you see a "404 Resource not found" error, check:

1. That the deployment name in your `.env.azure` file matches the actual deployment in your Azure account
2. The API version is correct (recommend using `2023-12-01-preview`)
3. Your API key has access to the specified deployment

### Recall Network Errors

If you encounter Recall Network errors, check:

1. The `.env.export` file is correctly sourced
2. The bucket address is valid
3. Your environment has proper network connectivity

## Adding New Tests

To add new tests:

1. Create a new test file in the `tests` directory with the `.test.ts` extension
2. Import the necessary testing utilities from `bun:test`
3. Structure tests using `describe()` and `test()` functions
4. Add the new test to the appropriate npm script in `package.json`

## Building the Project

```bash
# Clean and build the TypeScript code
bun run clean:build

# Just build without cleaning
bun run build
```
