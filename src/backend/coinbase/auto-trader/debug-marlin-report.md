# Marlin CVM Deployment Debug Report

## Executive Summary

This report documents extensive troubleshooting of Marlin CVM job deployments where **on-chain transactions succeed but jobs do not appear in CLI list commands**. Transactions are consistently being submitted and confirmed on the blockchain, but the jobs cannot be found using standard Marlin CLI commands. This disconnect suggests an underlying issue in the job lifecycle management, possibly related to network selection, control plane communication, or job state tracking.

## Commands Used to Check Job Status

### Primary Check Command
```bash
# Command run at 23:03:30 CET, March 22, 2025
export WALLET_ADDRESS=0x9Ac44C807FfcAf3e150e184a06a660EaE5b848C8
oyster-cvm list --address $WALLET_ADDRESS
```

### Command Output
```
2025-03-22T22:03:30.741341Z  INFO oyster_cvm::commands::list: Listing active jobs for wallet address: 0x9Ac44C807FfcAf3e150e184a06a660EaE5b848C8
2025-03-22T22:03:31.381102Z  INFO oyster_cvm::commands::list: No active jobs found for address: 0x9Ac44C807FfcAf3e150e184a06a660EaE5b848C8
```

### Job Monitoring Script
The monitoring script (`monitor-job-final.sh`) located at `/Users/pc/apps/MPC/hackathons/TEEfecta/mono/src/backend/coinbase/auto-trader/monitor-job-final.sh` was used to attempt to locate job information by multiple means:

1. List command with wallet address
2. Direct control plane queries to various endpoints
3. Attempting job updates

### Control Plane Query Endpoints Tested
- `http://13.202.229.168:8080/job/<job-id>`
- `http://13.202.229.168:8080/jobs?wallet=<wallet-address>`
- `http://13.202.229.168:8080/status/<job-id>`

## Detailed Deployment Information

### Wallet Address Consistency
- **Confirmed Wallet Address**: `0x9Ac44C807FfcAf3e150e184a06a660EaE5b848C8`
- **Private Key Location**: Environment variable `MARLIN` in `~/.zshrc`
- **Extraction Method**: `grep "export MARLIN=" ~/.zshrc | grep -o '"[^"]*"' | sed 's/"//g'`

### Deployment Commands
Multiple deployment approaches were used:

#### Docker Compose Deployment
```bash
export MARLIN=$(grep "export MARLIN=" ~/.zshrc | grep -o '"[^"]*"' | sed 's/"//g')
oyster-cvm deploy --wallet-private-key "$MARLIN" \
  --duration-in-minutes 360 \
  --docker-compose marlin-docker-compose.yml
```

#### Direct Image Deployment
```bash
export MARLIN=$(grep "export MARLIN=" ~/.zshrc | grep -o '"[^"]*"' | sed 's/"//g')
oyster-cvm deploy --wallet-private-key "$MARLIN" \
  --duration-in-minutes 15 \
  --image cyama/auto-trader:latest
```

### Docker Image Details
- **Image Name**: `cyama/auto-trader:latest`
- **Base Image**: `node:18-alpine`
- **Port Exposed**: 3222
- **Network Mode**: host (in docker-compose)

### Docker Compose File
File: `/Users/pc/apps/MPC/hackathons/TEEfecta/mono/src/backend/coinbase/auto-trader/marlin-docker-compose.yml`
```yaml
services:
  auto-trader:
    image: cyama/auto-trader:latest
    network_mode: host
    restart: unless-stopped
    command: sh -c "echo 'Server starting on port 3222' && node -e \"const http=require('http');const server=http.createServer((req,res)=>{res.writeHead(200);res.end('4g3n7 AutoTrader Running on CVM!');});server.listen(3222,'0.0.0.0',()=>console.log('Server running at http://0.0.0.0:3222/'));\""
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
      - PORT=3222
      - ENABLE_AGENTKIT=true
      - ENABLE_COLLABORATION=true
      - USE_MOCK_WALLET=false
      - USE_MOCK_SEARCH=false
      - RECALL_MEMORY_MODE=in-memory
      - PREFERRED_LLM_PROVIDER=gemini
      - CDP_NETWORK_ID=base-sepolia
```

## Deep Technical Analysis of the Disconnect

Based on the evidence collected, there are several potential causes for the disconnect between successful on-chain transactions and the inability to locate jobs through the CLI:

### 1. Network Selection Issues

The Marlin CVM appears to support multiple blockchain networks. If transactions are happening on one network but queries are defaulting to another, this would explain the disconnect.

**Default Network Analysis**:
- Transactions appear to be on Arbitrum (based on block numbers in 318XXXXXX range)
- The `list` command may be defaulting to a different network (e.g., Polygon)
- The deployment commands may not be explicitly specifying the network

**Test Commands**:
```bash
# Not tried yet - explicit network specifications
oyster-cvm list --address $WALLET_ADDRESS --network arbitrum
oyster-cvm list --address $WALLET_ADDRESS --network polygon
oyster-cvm list --address $WALLET_ADDRESS --network ethereum
```

### 2. Job Lifecycle State Management Issues

The jobs could be in a state that isn't recognized as "active" by the `list` command.

**Evidence**:
- Metadata update transactions are succeeding on-chain
- Job Open transactions are succeeding on-chain
- Yet jobs don't appear in active job lists

**Potential States**:
- Jobs could be marked as "closed" immediately after being opened
- Jobs could be "pending" in a state not queried by the list command
- Jobs could be "errored" in the control plane but still exist on-chain

### 3. Control Plane Communication Issues

The blockchain is one part of the system, but the control plane (which assigns IPs and tracks operational status) might be another failure point.

**Evidence**:
- Direct control plane queries are not returning expected data
- Update commands are not showing job information
- Error seen previously in logs: `error decoding response body: expected value at line 1 column 1`

**Control Plane Status**:
- The control plane may be experiencing issues
- There may be a mismatch between the blockchain state and control plane state
- The control plane URL may be incorrect or inaccessible from current network

### 4. CLI Version or Compatibility Issues

The version of the `oyster-cvm` CLI may impact its ability to interact with the control plane or blockchain.

**CLI Version**:
- Current CLI version: `0.1.0` (from logs)
- The CLI may require updating
- There may be compatibility issues with certain networks or features

### 5. Deployment Parameter Issues

Specific parameters in the deployment may be causing unexpected behavior.

**Parameter Analysis**:
- The docker-compose file appears valid
- The image is accessible on Docker Hub
- Duration settings varied across deployments but none appeared in list
- Instance type selection may be affecting deployment success

## Specific Misalignment Points

1. **Network Specification Missing**: Most commands don't specify the network explicitly.
   - Critical files: `monitor-job-final.sh`, `check-job-status.sh`, `direct-image-deploy.sh`
   - Used commands: `oyster-cvm list --address $WALLET_ADDRESS` (no network flag)
   - Correction needed: Add `--network arbitrum` to all commands

2. **CLI Options Mismatch**: Based on the CLI logging output, there may be a discrepancy in which flags are supported.
   - Expected: `--network` flag
   - Actual: May not support `--network` flag in this version

3. **Job ID Format Inconsistency**: The job IDs from on-chain transactions vs. what's expected by monitoring scripts may differ.
   - On-chain format: Not explicitly visible in transaction data
   - Script format: `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000b66`
   - Potential fix: Ensure job ID formats match between creation and querying

4. **Timing of Status Checks**: The delay between job creation and status checks may be insufficient.
   - Current: Monitoring begins immediately after transaction
   - Required: May need longer wait periods (10+ minutes)

## Next Debugging Steps

1. **Check Multiple Networks**:
```bash
# Create a script to check across all possible networks
for network in arbitrum polygon optimism ethereum base; do
  echo "Checking network: $network"
  oyster-cvm list --address $WALLET_ADDRESS --network $network
done
```

2. **Examine CLI Help for Network Options**:
```bash
oyster-cvm --help
oyster-cvm list --help
```

3. **Verify CLI Version Compatibility**:
```bash
oyster-cvm --version
# Consider updating if needed
```

4. **Direct Transaction Job ID Query**:
```bash
# Extract job ID directly from the most recent transaction
# Then query that specific job ID
JOB_ID=0x... # from transaction data
oyster-cvm list --job-id $JOB_ID
```

5. **Alternative API Queries**:
```bash
# Try querying the blockchain directly for job status
# This would require custom code using ethers.js
```

## Conclusion and Primary Hypothesis

The most likely cause of the disconnect between on-chain transactions and job visibility is a **network selection mismatch**. The transactions are being submitted to the Arbitrum blockchain, but the list command may be defaulting to a different network (possibly Polygon, based on Marlin documentation defaults).

Secondary possibilities include control plane communication issues or job state management problems, but the network mismatch is the most straightforward explanation for why well-formed and successful transactions wouldn't result in visible jobs.

**Recommended immediate fix**: Explicitly specify the network in all commands as `--network arbitrum`.

If that doesn't resolve the issue, a deeper investigation of the control plane communication and job lifecycle states would be warranted.
