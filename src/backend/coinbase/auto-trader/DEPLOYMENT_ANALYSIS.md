# Marlin CVM Deployment Analysis

## Current Status

As of March 22, 2025, we have conducted a thorough investigation of the Marlin CVM deployment issues. Our analysis included:

1. Verification of the Marlin CLI version and capabilities
2. Testing of wallet address derivation and consistency
3. Analysis of docker-compose configuration
4. Verification of PCR values for attestation

## CLI Analysis

The `oyster-cvm` CLI is version 0.1.0 and includes the following key commands:

- `deploy`: Deploy an Oyster CVM instance
- `list`: List active jobs for a wallet address
- `logs`: Stream logs from an Oyster CVM instance
- `deposit`: Deposit funds to an existing job
- `withdraw`: Withdraw funds from an existing job
- `stop`: Stop an Oyster CVM instance

### Key Findings:

1. The CLI does **not** have a `--network` flag as we previously assumed. This explains why our network testing script failed.
2. The CLI has a `--debug` option for the `deploy` command but not for `verify`.
3. The `user-attestation` command is not available in this version.

## Docker Compose Analysis

We examined the current docker-compose file and identified several potential issues:

1. **Network Mode**: Using `network_mode: host` may not be compatible with the enclave environment.
2. **Command Length**: The command is quite long and complex, which could lead to parsing issues.
3. **Environment Variables**: Too many environment variables that may not be necessary for a minimal test.

We created a simplified docker-compose file with:
- Standard port mapping instead of host network mode
- Simplified command structure
- Minimal environment variables

## Wallet Address Consistency

We verified the wallet address `0x9Ac44C807FfcAf3e150e184a06a660EaE5b848C8` is correctly derived from the private key. This address is now consistently used in all scripts.

## Image Accessibility

We confirmed the Docker image `cyama/auto-trader:latest` is accessible and can be pulled successfully. The image has the digest `sha256:eb8e8dd081b426f9c327ac916d0165da783a184c636f8c5cede9bd789e1110d2`.

## PCR Values

According to Marlin documentation, PCR values are important for attestation. We attempted to check PCR values but the `verify` command requires an enclave IP which we don't have yet.

## Recommended Solutions

Based on our analysis, we recommend the following approaches to resolve the deployment issues:

### 1. Simplified Deployment

Use the simplified docker-compose file with fewer settings:
```yaml
services:
  auto-trader:
    image: cyama/auto-trader:latest
    ports:
      - "3222:3222"
    restart: always
    command: sh -c "node -e \"const http=require('http');const server=http.createServer((req,res)=>{res.writeHead(200);res.end('4g3n7 AutoTrader Running on CVM!');});server.listen(3222,'0.0.0.0',()=>console.log('Server running at http://0.0.0.0:3222/'));\""
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
      - PORT=3222
```

### 2. Debug Deployment Mode

Use the `--debug` flag with the deployment command to get more information:
```bash
oyster-cvm deploy \
  --wallet-private-key "$MARLIN" \
  --duration-in-minutes 15 \
  --docker-compose marlin-docker-compose.yml \
  --debug
```

### 3. Direct Image Deployment

Try deploying with a direct image reference instead of docker-compose:
```bash
oyster-cvm deploy \
  --wallet-private-key "$MARLIN" \
  --duration-in-minutes 15 \
  --image cyama/auto-trader:latest
```

### 4. Instance Type Specification

Add explicit instance type and region parameters:
```bash
oyster-cvm deploy \
  --wallet-private-key "$MARLIN" \
  --duration-in-minutes 15 \
  --docker-compose marlin-docker-compose.yml \
  --debug \
  --instance-type "c7g.xlarge" \
  --region ap-south-1
```

## Implementation Plan

We've created several scripts to help test these solutions:

1. `debug-deployment.sh`: Deploys with debug mode enabled
2. `fix-marlin-compose.sh`: Creates a simplified docker-compose file
3. `test-simplified-deployment.sh`: Deploys using the simplified compose file
4. `check-oyster-version.sh`: Checks CLI version and capabilities
5. `verify-pcr-values.sh`: Attempts to verify PCR values

We recommend testing these scripts in the following order:

1. Run `./test-simplified-deployment.sh` to try the simplified deployment
2. If unsuccessful, run `./debug-deployment.sh` to get more detailed logs
3. Check for any errors in the logs and adjust the approach accordingly

## Additional Considerations

1. **Balance Check**: Verify that the wallet has sufficient USDC balance
2. **Transaction Verification**: Check if transactions are successfully processed on-chain
3. **Support Contact**: If issues persist, contact Marlin support with transaction hashes and logs

## Conclusion

The deployment issues appear to be related to the docker-compose configuration and potentially the way the deployment command is executed. By simplifying the configuration and using the debug mode, we can gather more information to resolve the issues.

The most promising approach is to use the simplified docker-compose file with the debug flag enabled. This will provide more visibility into the deployment process and help identify any specific issues that need to be addressed.
