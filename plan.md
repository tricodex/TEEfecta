# 4g3n7 Project Plan

## Vision

- **Marlin Oyster CVM**: Primary TEE for secure execution
- **Coinbase AgentKit**: Financial management within CVM
- **Azure AI Foundry**: Agentkit LLM provider through Langchain
- **Nillion SecretLLM**: Secondary AI verification with smaller models
- **Recall Network**: Storage of reasoning trails
- **t1 Protocol**: Transaction settlement verification
- **Privy**: User authentication and wallet integration

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Secure Environment Setup

- Deploy Marlin Oyster CVM infrastructure
- Implement attestation verification
- Establish secure communication channels

### Phase 2: Core Trading Integration

- Integrate AgentKit within CVM
- Set up Azure AI model deployment pipeline
- Develop trading logic foundation
- Implement secure API interfaces

### Phase 3: Transparency Layer

- Integrate Recall Network for decision storage
- Implement t1 Protocol for settlement verification
- Add Nillion for fact-checking capabilities

### Phase 4: User Interface Development

- Implement Privy authentication
- Build monitoring dashboard
- Create trade approval workflows
- Develop notification system

## Technical Priorities

1. **Security**: All sensitive operations must occur within the TEE
2. **Privacy**: User data never exposed outside secure environments
3. **Transparency**: All decisions recorded with verifiable proofs
4. **Usability**: Intuitive interface for both crypto-native and new users

## Success Metrics

- Secure execution with verifiable attestation
- Zero exposure of sensitive user data
- Transparent and auditable decision trails

## Immediate Next Steps

1. Set up development environment with Marlin CVM
2. Create API specifications for component interactions
3. AgentKit integration
4. Design initial system architecture diagram
