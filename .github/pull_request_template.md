## Tests

<!--
When adding new functionality or fixing a bug, you should be testing your changes with one or more
chatbots in the examples directory.

Please provide samples of the prompts you tested with, the Agent outputs for each prompt,
which chatbot you used, and any other relevant context, like which network was used.

Use the following format if helpful:

```
Chatbot: <name of chatbot used>
Network: <network used>
Setup: <any other relevant context>

Prompt: <prompt>

<agent output>
```

For example:

```
Chatbot: typescript/examples/langchain-cdp-chatbot/chatbot.ts
Network: Base Sepolia
Setup: Fauceted with 1 USDC

Prompt: print USDC balance (token address: 0x036CbD53842c5426634e7929541eC2318f3dCF7e)

-------------------
Balance of 0x036CbD53842c5426634e7929541eC2318f3dCF7e is 1
-------------------
The USDC balance for the token address `0x036CbD53842c5426634e7929541eC2318f3dCF7e` is 1.
-------------------
